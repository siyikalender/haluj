# haluj
## Description

This is a header only lightweight toolbox written in C++. It consists several small utilities, which are hoped to be helpful when developing on small devices such as microcontrollers.

(Developers Note, previously this library was intended to be a bare metal framework for microcontroller based applications. Due to some difficulties faced, microcontroller related parts are decided to be removed. These parts will be handled as separate repository.)
